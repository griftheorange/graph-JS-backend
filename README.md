# Graph-JS Backend README

The purpose of this project was to experiment with and learn the D3.js library by using it to mimic Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel's graphing functions.

The goal was to create a one-page website in Javascript onto which you could upload CSV files, parse them into tables, then generate graphs from the tables. The CSV files would be persisted to an external server and the access URL saved to the backend. Users would then be able to access all uploaded datasets and create graphs by specifying columns for axes and data series.

The result is simple enough, but was great practice for learning D3's features for the first time. Users can perform all of the above and generate three classic charts. Bar, Line, and Pie Charts.
